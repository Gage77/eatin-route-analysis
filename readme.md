# OU EATIN (Engineers Assisting Those In Need) Meals on Wheels Route Analysis and Optimization

This simple web application serves to take an input of addresses provided by Meals on Wheels Norman and establish optimal routes for all drivers for a given day.

### Goals/Constraints:
- Generate and display most possible route
- Keep routes under 1.5 hours (usually done between 11 - 12:30)
- Keep routes under 20 miles (less if possible)
- Space is generally not an issue, time is a big one
- Many drivers have been volunteering for a long time and will not want to change route
- Getting volunteers for more routes is difficult, but not impossible

### Current tools being used:
- mealdeliverysoftware.com/software/
- Current routes are available by logging in and downloading a csv by going to "Delivery" -> "Delivery Reports" -> "Delivery Address Data".
